## 💡 Key Learnings (Theory)

- Browser extensions can become a security risk if they are from unknown sources, request overly broad permissions, or inject unwanted ads or scripts into web pages. [file:1]  
- Regularly checking the extensions page helps maintain a clean and secure browser environment and reduces the chances of data theft, tracking, or malicious behavior by unwanted add‑ons. [file:1]
